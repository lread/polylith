  Shows the output from the info, deps, and libs commands, side by side.
  This command is mainly used to generate an image for your documentation
  and is only available from the polyx tool.

  We can duplicate the :poly alias in ./deps.edn and rename it to :polyx and
  change :deps/root to "projects/polyx" to get access to the :polyx command.

  poly overview [:no-changes] [out:FILENAME]
    (omitted)   = Shows the output.
    :no-changes = Shows the output as if there were no changes in the workspace.
    out         = Creates a text or image file based on the output.
                  If FILENAME ends with .txt, then the file will contain
                  the output as text. If FILENAME ends with .bmp, .wbmp, .gif,
                  .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, or .tiff, then the file will be
                  generated as an image.

  Example:
    clojure -M:polyx overview
    clojure -M:polyx overview out:overview.png
    clojure -M:polyx overview out:overview.jpg :no-changes
