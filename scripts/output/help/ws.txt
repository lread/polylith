  Prints or writes the workspace as data.

  poly ws [get:ARG] [out:FILE] [branch:BRANCH] [:latest-sha]

    ARG = keys  -> Lists the keys for the data structure:
                   - If it's a hash map, it returns all its keys.
                   - If it's a list and its elements are hash maps,
                     it returns a vector with all the :name keys.

          count -> Counts the number of elements.

          KEY   -> If applied to a hash map, it returns the value of the KEY.
                   If applied to a list of hash maps, it returns the hash map with
                   a matching :name. Projects are also matched against :alias
                   e.g. 'dev' instead of 'development'.

          INDEX -> A list element can be looked up by INDEX.

          Several ARG keys can be given, separated by colon.
          Every new key goes one level deeper into the workspace data structure.

    FILE = Writes the output to the specified FILE. Will have the same effect
           as setting color-mode:none and piping the output to a file.

    BRANCH = Can be used together with :latest-sh to set the branch to use
             if other than 'main'.

    :latest-sha = if passed in, then settings:vcs:polylith:latest-sha will be set,
                  by retreiving the latest sha from the 'main' branch.
