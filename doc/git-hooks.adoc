= Git hook

We can ensure that we don't push code that puts the workspace in an invalid state, by adding a https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks[git hook] to our workspace, that executes the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command.

To make this work, all developers should add _.git/hooks/commit-msg_ to the root of the workspace on their local disk with the following content, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

exec /usr/bin/java -jar /usr/local/polylith/poly.jar check color-mode:none ws-dir:PATH-TO-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]] ; then
  exit 1
fi
----

Replace _PATH-TO-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY_ with the path to the workspace root.
