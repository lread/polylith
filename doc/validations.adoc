= Validations

Each time we execute the xref:commands.adoc#check[check], xref:commands.adoc#info[info],
or xref:commands.adoc#test[test] command, the workspace is validated.
The various checks that are executed can be listed by executing the help for the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command:

[source,shell]
----
poly help check
----

The _test_ command will not be executed if _check_ discovers any errors.

[#warning206]
=== Warning 206 - Unreadable namespace in brick/project

If a source file (_.clj_ or _.cljc_) can't be read or if the namespace is missing, we get _Warning 206 - Unreadable namespace in brick/project_.

If we comment out the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/examples/doc-example/components/user/src/se/example/user/core.clj[core] namespace
for the _user_ component in the example app and execute the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command, it will show a warning:

[source,clojure]
----
;(ns se.example.user.core)

(defn hello [name]
  (str "Hello " name "!!"))
----

image::images/validations/missing-or-unreadable-namespace.png[]

If we have a look at the namespace:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:components:user:namespaces:src:core
----

...we can see that it's marked as invalid:

[source,clojure]
----
{:file-path "components/user/src/se/example/user/core.clj",
 :imports [],
 :is-invalid true,
 :name "core",
 :namespace ""}
----

[#ignore-files]
If we want to get rid of this warning, we can add the filename to _:ignore-files_ for the _user_ component:

[source,clojure]
----
{ ...
 :bricks {"user" {:ignore-files ["core.clj"]}}
  ...
}
----

If a file is ignored, it's no longer considered as invalid.

Any path that matches "core.clj" exact or ends with "/core.clj" is considered a match, e.g. "core.clj", "user/core.clj"
or "example/user/core.clj", but not "ore.clj" because it will try to match "/ore.clj"
(a slash is appended when comparing). If we use a dash (-) in the filename (to mimic the namespace name)
it will be replaced by an underscore (_) so that it can match correctly against the actual Clojure filename.

If we now look at the namespaces for the _user_ component again, the core namespace will be marked as ignored:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:components:user:namespaces:src:core
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:file-path "components/user/src/se/example/user/core.clj",
 :imports [],
 :is-ignored true,
 :name "core",
 :namespace ""}
----

It's also possible to ignore files in projects, e.g.:

[source,clojure]
----
{ ...
 :projects {...
            "command-line" {...
                            :ignore-files ["test-setup.clj"]
                            ...}
            ...}

  ...
}
----

Which will ignore all files with the name "test_setup.clj" or files that end with "/test-setup.clj" in the _command-line_ project.

The https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/examples/doc-example/projects/command-line/test/project/command_line/test_setup.clj[test-setup]
namespace in the _command-line_ project will be ignored, and _:is-ignored_ will be set to _true_ for the namespace:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:projects:command-line:namespaces:test:project.command-line.test-setup
----

[source,clojure]
----
{:file-path "projects/command-line/test/project/command_line/test_setup.clj",
 :imports ["clojure.test"],
 :is-ignored true,
 :name "project.command-line.test-setup",
 :namespace "project.command-line.test-setup"}

[#warning206]
=== Warning 207 - Unnecessary components were found in project

If there are any unnecessary components in a project (i.e. that are not used by any of the bricks in the project),
then xref:commands.adoc#check[check] will return _Warning 207 - Unnecessary components were found in project_.

By default, _check_ only runs for projects under the _projects_ directory.
To also check the _development_ project, we have to pass in _:dev_ when executing the _check_ command.
Warning 207 will not be checked for the _info_ and _test_ commands.
All other validations are performed when executing the _check_, _info_, or _test_ command.

If we get warning 207 for a project, but we know that the component is needed
(e.g. used in a dynamic way, but not explicitly called) then we can add a _:necessary_ key
to the project in _workspace.edn_ to get rid of the warning (this example is taken from the `poly` tool itself):

[source,clojure]
----
{ ...
 :projects {...
            "poly" {:alias "poly" :necessary ["clojure-test-test-runner"]}
            ...}}
}
----

All errors and warnings are also stored in the workspace structure and can be viewed by executing:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:messages
----

If we don't have any warnings or errors, it will return an empty result:

[source,shell]
----
[]
----
