= Development

When working with a Polylith codebase, we are free to choose any editor/IDE we like, for example:

* https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] / https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider[Cider]

* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] / https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva[Calva]

* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IDEA] / https://cursive-ide.com/[Cursive].

Here we will use Cursive, and if you do too, make sure you have https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html[tools.deps] configured correctly.

Let's get started by creating a project. From the menu, select `File > New > Project from existing sources`.
Select the `deps.edn` file, the desired version of SDK and finish the wizard.

If you are a Cursive user, and use version `1.13.0` or later, then you need to select "Resolve over whole project" in the settings:

Make sure to activate the `:dev` alias (and press the "two arrows" icon to refresh):

image::images/development/activate-dev-alias.png[width=250]

Let's create a REPL by clicking `Edit Configurations...`:

image::images/development/edit-configuration.png[width=200]

Click the `+` sign and select `Clojure REPL > Local`:

image::images/development/create-local-repl.png[width=250]

Fill in:

* Name: `REPL`
* Which type of REPL to run: `nREPL`
* Run with Deps: (select)
* Options: `-A:dev:test`
* Module: `example`

Press OK and start the REPL in debug mode, by clicking the bug icon:

When this turns up:

[source,shell]
----
Clojure 1.11.1
nREPL server started on port 56855 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:56855
----

...we are ready to go!

If we look at the `deps.edn` file again, we can see that "development/src" was already added to the path:

[source,shell]
----
 :aliases  {:dev {:extra-paths ["development/src"]
----

This gives us access to the `development/src` directory so that we can work with the code.

The "development/src" path belongs to the `dev` alias which we activated previously and also added to the REPL
by selecting the `-A:dev:test` option. This means that we have configured everything that
https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha[tools.deps] needs and that we are ready to write some Clojure code!

To do that we first need to create a namespace. We suggest that you use `dev` as a top namespace here
and not the workspace top namespace `se.example`.
The reason is that we don't want to mix the code we put here with the production code.

One way of structuring the code is to give all developers their own namespace under the `dev` top namespace.
Let's follow that pattern and create the namespace `dev.lisa`.

Right-click on the `development/src` directory and select `New > Clojure Namespace` and type `dev.lisa`:

When this dialog turns up, select `Don't ask again` and click the `Add` button:

image::images/development/add-file-to-git.png[width=600]

If the namespace is not recognised, you may need to click the refresh button (two arrows):

image::images/development/refresh.png[width=150]

Now let's write some code:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns dev.lisa)

(+ 1 2 3)
----

Make sure the namespace is loaded, by sending `(ns dev.lisa)` to the REPL. If we then send `(+ 1 2 3)` to the REPL
we should get `6` back, and if we do, it means that we now have a working development environment!
