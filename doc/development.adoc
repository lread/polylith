When working with a Polylith codebase, we are free to choose any editor/IDE we like, for example:

* https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] / https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider[Cider]

* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode] / https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva[Calva]

* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IDEA] / https://cursive-ide.com/[Cursive].

Here we will use Cursive, and if you do, make sure you have https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html[tools.deps] configured correctly.

Let's get started by creating a project. From the menu, select _File > New > Project from existing sources_. Select the _deps.edn_ file, the desired version of SDK and finish the wizard.

If you are a Cursive user (1.13.0 or later) then you need to select "Resolve over whole project" in the settings:

Make sure to activate the :dev alias (and press the "two arrows" icon to refresh):

image::images/development/activate-dev-alias.png[alt=Activate the :dev alias,width=250]

Let's create a REPL by clicking _Edit Configurations..._:

image::images/development/edit-configuration.png[alt=Edit configuration...,width=200]

Click the + sign and select _Clojure REPL_ > _Local_:

image::images/development/create-local-repl.png[alt=Create local REPL,width=250]

Fill in:

* Name: REPL
* Which type of REPL to run: nREPL
* Run with Deps: (select)
* Options: -A:dev:test
* Module: example

Press OK and start the REPL in debug mode, by clicking the bug icon:

image::images/development/debug.png[alt=Debug,width=150]


When this turns up:

[source,shell]
----
Clojure 1.11.1
nREPL server started on port 56855 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:56855
----

...we are ready to go!

If we look at the _deps.edn_ file again, we can see that "development/src" was already added to the path:

[source,shell]
----
 :aliases  {:dev {:extra-paths ["development/src"]
----

This gives us access to the _development/src_ directory so that we can work with the code.

The "development/src" path belongs to the _dev_ alias which we activated previously and also added to the REPL by selecting the _-A:dev:test_ option. This means that we have configured everything that https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha[tools.deps] needs and that we are ready to write some Clojure code!

To do that we first need to create a namespace. We suggest that you use _dev_ as a top namespace here and not the workspace top namespace _se.example_. The reason is that we don't want to mix the code we put here with the production code.

One way of structuring the code is to give all developers their own namespace under the _dev_ top namespace. Let's follow that pattern and create the namespace _dev.lisa_.

Right click on the _development/src_ directory and select _New > Clojure Namespace_ and type _dev.lisa_:

When this dialog turns up, select _Don't ask again_ and click the _Add_ button:

image::images/development/add-file-to-git.png[alt=Debug,width=600]

If the namespace is not recognised, you may need to click the refresh button (two arrows):

image::images/development/refresh.png[alt=Add file to git,width=150]

Now let's write some code:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns dev.lisa)

(+ 1 2 3)
----

Make sure the namespace is loaded, by sending `(ns dev.lisa)` to the REPL. If we then send `(+ 1 2 3)` to the REPL we should get 6 back, and if we do, it means that we now have a working development environment!
