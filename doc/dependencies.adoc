= Dependencies

If you are looking for library dependencies, then visit the #xref:libraries.adoc[Libraries] section.

To explain dependencies, we will use the https://github.com/furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app[RealWorld example app].

Start by cloning the project by executing these commands from outside the example workspace, e.g. the parent folder of our example workspace:

[source,shell]
----
clone-from-here
├── example
└── clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app
----

[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:furkan3ayraktar/clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app.git
cd clojure-polylith-realworld-example-app
----

Before we continue, it may be worth mentioning that most commands, except the xref:commands.adoc#test[test] and xref:commands.adoc#create[create] commands, can be executed from other workspaces by giving _ws-dir_, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly check ws-dir:../example
----

Another way of giving the _ws-dir_ is to pass in _::_ which will set it to the first parent directory that contains a _workspace.edn_ file, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
cd projects/realworld-backend
poly info ::
----

...which in this case is the same as:

[source,shell]
----
poly info ws-dir:../..
----

Now let's have a look at the workspace:

[source,shell]
----
cd ../..
poly info
----

image::images/dependencies/info.png[alt=info,width=400]

Now we have some bricks to play with!

Let's list all dependencies by executing the deps command:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps
----

image::images/dependencies/deps.png[alt=deps,width=400]

This lists all dependencies in the workspace. Notice the yellow color in the headers. They are yellow because components and bases normally only depend on interfaces. Each _x_ is a _src_ dependency, while a _t_ means it only exists in the _test_ context.

If we read the diagram horizontally, we can see that the _article_ component uses the _database_, _profile_, and _spec_ interfaces. If we read it vertically, we can see that the _article_ is used by the _comment_ and _rest-api_ bricks.

This is also what is shown if we specify article as brick:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps brick:article
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-brick.png[alt=deps brick:article,width=350]

To list the component dependencies, we need to specify a project:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps project:rb
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-project.png[alt=deps project:rb,width=350]

Now, all the headers are green, and that is because all the implementing components are known within the selected project. The _+_ signs mark indirect dependencies, while _-_ signs mark indirect test dependencies (not present here). An example is the _article_ component that uses _log_ indirectly: _article_ > _database_ > _log_.

[#compact-view]
If we have many libraries, they can be viewed in a more compact format:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps project:rb :compact
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-project-compact.png[alt=deps project:rb :compact,width=300]

This can be set permanently by setting _:compact-views #{"deps"}_ in _workspace.edn_.

We can also show dependencies for a specific brick within a project:

[source,shell]
----
poly deps project:rb brick:article
----

image::images/dependencies/deps-brick-project.png[alt=deps project:rb brick:article,width=350]

== Depend on namespaces

From the _:src_ context, components can only depend on interfaces, but bases can depend on both component interfaces and any namespace in a brick, e.g. another base (if you have more than one base in the project).

Components are allowed to access other components test code from its _:test_ context. Bases are allowed to access any test code in components and bases. Accessing other bases' test code from a base is fine, but accessing other components' test code has the disadvantage that it will make it more difficult to swap out a component for another, because it may break code that depends on that test code.

A better strategy is to create a separate test-helper component, put the shared code there, and depend on that component's interface.

== Circular dependencies

The poly tool is checking for circular dependencies. If we have a dependency chain like A > B > A, or A > B > C > A, then we will get an "Error 104 - Circular dependencies". To read more about this and other errors, we can execute `poly help check`.
