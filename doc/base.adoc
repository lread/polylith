= Base

A `base` is similar to a `component` except for two things:

* It doesn't have an `interface`.

* It exposes a public API to the outside world.

The lack of an `interface` makes bases less composable compared to components.
This is okay because they serve a different purpose which is to be a bridge between the real world and the components it delegates to.
This gives us the modularity and structure we need to build simple and understandable services and tools.

Let's create the `cli` base to see how it works, by executing the xref:commands.adoc#create-base[create base] command:

[source,shell]
----
poly create base name:cli
----

Our workspace should now look like this:

[source,shell]
----

│   └── cli
│       ├── deps.edn
│       ├── resources
│       │   └── cli

│       │   └── se
│       │       └── example
│       │           └── cli
│       │               └── core.clj
│       └── test
│           └── se
│               └── example
│                   └── cli
│                       └── core_test.clj

Now we need to update `./deps.edn` with our newly created base:

[source,clojure]
----
 :aliases  {:dev {:extra-paths ["development/src"]

                  :extra-deps {poly/user {:local/root "components/user"}
                               poly/cli  {:local/root "bases/cli"}

                               org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}}}

            :test {:extra-paths ["components/user/test"
                                 "bases/cli/test"]}
----

Refresh the IDE with the new settings and let's add some code to the base:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns se.example.cli.core
  (:require [se.example.user.interface :as user])
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main [& args]
  (println (user/hello (first args)))
  (System/exit 0))
----

Here we added the `-main` function that will later be called from the command line.
The https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/gen-class[:gen-class] statement
tells the compiler to generate a Java class for us when the code is compiled.

A `deps.edn` file was also created with this content:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src" "resources"]
 :deps {}
 :aliases {:test {:extra-paths ["test"]
                  :extra-deps {}}}}
----

This config file is identical to the `user` config file, and will soon be needed when we create a project that uses it.

====
NOTE: It's important that we don't add a dependency to the `users` component in the base's `deps.edn` file.
The `cli` base will automatically "connect" to the `user` component, via the user's xref:interface.adoc[interface], when both are added to a xref:project.adoc[project].
The base (or any brick) don't know about concrete components, just xref:interface.adoc[interfaces].
====

The next thing we want to do is to build an xref:artifacts.adoc[artifact] that will turn the code into something useful, a command-line tool.
To do that, we need to start by creating a project.
