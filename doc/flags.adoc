= Flags

We have one more thing to cover regarding the info command, and that is what the -, s, t and x flags mean:

[source,shell]
----
example
├── build.clj

image::images/flags/projects.png[alt=Projects,width=350]

The status column has a different meaning:

|===
| status | Explanation

| s-- | The project has a _src_ directory
| -t- | The project has a _test_ directory
| --x | Run the tests for this project
|===

If the "to be tested" flag _--x_ is marked for a project under the status column, it means that the tests for that project will be executed from at least one project, which often is the project itself and/or the _development_ project.

Under the _status_ column, the _---_ means we have a _projects/command-line_ directory but no _src_ or _test_ directories in it and that no tests will be executed for this project.

Under the _status_ column, the _s--_ means we have a _development/src_ directory but no _development/test_ directory and that no tests will be executed for this project.

Each flag under _dev_ has a slightly different meaning, where project refers to _development_:

|===
| status | Explanation

| s-- | The _src_ directory is included in the development project
| -t- | The _test_ directory is included in the development project
| --x | Run the tests for this brick from the development project
|===

Under the _dev_ column, the _---_ means that neither _projects/command-line/src_ or _projects/command-line/test_ is added to _./deps.edn_ and that no tests in _projects/command-line/test_ will be executed from the _development_ project.

Under the _dev_ column, the _s--_ means that _development/src_ is added to _./deps.edn_ but not _development/test_ and that no tests in _development/test_ will be executed from the _development_ project.

We also have this section:

image::images/flags/bricks.png[alt=Projects,width=300]

Here the flags have a slightly different meaning:

|===
| status | Explanation

| s-- | The brick's _src_ directory is included in this project
| -t- | The brick's _test_ directory is included in this project
| --x | Run the tests for this brick from this project
|===

The _st-_ for the _user_ component under the _dev_ column tells that both _components/user/src_ and _components/user/test_ are included in the _development_ projects, and that no brick tests will be executed.

The _./deps.edn_ looks like this:

[source,clojure]
----
 :aliases  {:dev {:extra-paths [...
                                "components/user/src"
                                "components/user/resources"
  ...
            :test {:extra-paths ["components/user/test"
----

The _st-_ for the _user_ component under the _cl_ column tells that _user_ is included in the _command-line_ project and that _user_ has both a _src_ and _test_ directory specified in its _deps.edn_ (probably indirectly included via a _:local/root_ statement) and that no brick tests will be executed.

The bricks for the _command-line_ project is configured in _projects/command-line/deps.edn_:

[source,clojure]
----
{:deps {poly/remote {:local/root "../../components/user"}
        poly/cli    {:local/root "../../bases/cli"}
----

...where the _src_, _resources_, and _test_ folders for the bricks are specified in _components/user/deps.edn_ and _bases/cli/deps.edn_ where both have this content:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src" "resources"]
 :deps {}
 :aliases {:test {:extra-paths ["test"]
                  :extra-deps {}}}}
----

The _st-_ for the _cli_ base follows the same pattern as for the _user_ component but for the _bases/cli_ directory.

If we execute `poly info :resources` (or the shorter `poly info :r`):

image::images/flags/info.png[alt=info,width=400]

...then the resources directory is also included, where r stands for resources.
