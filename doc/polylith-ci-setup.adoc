The polylith repository has a continuous integration and deployment setup via https://circleci.com[CircleCI].
The setup has two workflows, one for regular validation and testing, and another one for deployments.
Both workflows have several jobs that validate, test, and deploy the artifacts to https://clojars.org/search?q=polylith[Clojars], https://cljdoc.org/versions/polylith/clj-poly[cljdoc], and GitHub as https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases[releases].

We can find the CircleCI configuration file link:../.circleci/config.yml[here].

[#releases]
== Releases

A https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases[release] is triggered when a commit is pushed to master, often a squashed branch that fixes/implements an https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/issues[issue].
If SNAPSHOT is included in the version name, then it becomes a
https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/56a481b9a209bc013fbe1852d1797b4bba2bdf1a/components/version/src/polylith/clj/core/version/interface.clj#L26[snapshot] release, otherwise a "final" release.

==== Final release

A commit is pushed to the `master` branch where https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/56a481b9a209bc013fbe1852d1797b4bba2bdf1a/components/version/src/polylith/clj/core/version/interface.clj#L31[version]
is not a snapshot, e.g. `0.2.18` or `0.2.19`, which triggers a build in CircleCi that:

* Creates a https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases[release] of the `poly` tool.
* Releases the {cljdoc-api-url}/polylith[clj-poly] library to Clojars.
* Triggers a build of the web based https://cljdoc.org/d/polylith/clj-poly/CURRENT/doc/readme[cljdoc] documentation.

==== Snapshot release

A commit is pushed to the `master` branch where https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/56a481b9a209bc013fbe1852d1797b4bba2bdf1a/components/version/src/polylith/clj/core/version/interface.clj#L31[version]
is a snapshot, e.g. `0.2.19-SNAPSHOT`, which triggers a build in CircleCi that:

* Creates a https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository[pre-release] of the `poly` tool.
* Releases the snapshot version of the {cljdoc-api-url}/polylith[clj-poly] library to Clojars.
* Triggers a snapshot build of the web based https://cljdoc.org/d/polylith/clj-poly/CURRENT/doc/readme[cljdoc] documentation.

The same snapshot release can be triggered several times and will the overwrite the latest snapshot release.
The `poly` tool is not included in a snapshot release.

====
NOTE: The {cljdoc-doc-url}/next-release.txt[next-release.txt] file lists what has been included in the SNAPSHOT release, since the previous final release.
This file is cleared when making a final release.

== Validate Workflow

The main responsibility of this workflow is to validate the workspace and run the tests incrementally for all commits to all branches.
Specifically for the _master_ branch, it also marks the commit as stable via a git tag.

=== Jobs

==== Check

This job runs the check command from the `poly` tool as follows: `clojure -M:poly check`.
If there are any errors in the xref:workspace.adoc[workspace], it returns with a non-zero exit code and the CircleCI workflow stops at this stage.
If there are any warnings printed by the tool, it will be visible in the job's output.

==== Info

This job runs the following commands, one after another:

* `clojure -M:poly ws`
** Prints the current workspace as data in https://github.com/edn-format/edn[edn] format.
* `clojure -M:poly info`
** Prints workspace information.
* `clojure -M:poly deps`
** Prints the dependency information
* `clojure -M:poly libs`
** Prints all libraries that are used in the workspace.

After this job is done, all this information will be available in the jobs output for debugging purposes, if needed.
You can read more about available commands xref:commands.adoc[here].

==== Test

This job runs all the tests for all the bricks and projects that are directly or indirectly changed since the last stable point in time.
The `poly` tool supports incremental testing out-of-the-box by using stable point marks in the git repository.
It runs the following command: `clojure -M:poly test :project`.
If any of the tests fail, it will exit with a non-zero exit code and the CircleCI workflow stops at this stage.
Information about the passed/failed tests will be printed in the job's output.

==== Mark as stable

This job only runs for the commits made to the _master_ branch.
It adds (or replaces if already exists) the `stable-master` tag to the repository.
At this point in the workflow, it is "proven" that the Polylith workspace is valid and all of the tests are passed, and it's safe to mark this commit as stable.

It does that by running the following commands, one after another:

* `git tag -f -a &quot;stable-$CIRCLE_BRANCH&quot; -m &quot;[skip ci] Added Stable Polylith tag&quot;`
** Creates or moves the tag.
* `git push origin $CIRCLE_BRANCH --tags --force`
** Pushes the tag back to the git repository.

== Deploy Workflow

The main responsibility of this workflow is to validate the workspace, run the tests incrementally and deploy artifacts to Clojars and GitHub releases.
It only runs when a new tag is pushed to the git repository with the following regex pattern: `/^v.*/`.

=== Jobs

==== Check Build

This job runs the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command as follows: `clojure -M:poly check since:previous-release`.
Please note the last part of the command where we specifically tell the `poly` tool to check the workspace since the last release, instead of the last stable point in time.
If there are any errors in the Polylith workspace, it returns with a non-zero exit code and the CircleCI workflow stops at this stage.
If there are any warnings printed by the tool, it will be visible in the job's output.

==== Info

This job runs the following commands, one after another.
Please note the last part of the command, where we specifically tell the tool to check the workspace since the last release, instead of the last stable point in time:

* `clojure -M:poly ws since:previous-release`
** Prints the current workspace as data in https://github.com/edn-format/edn[edn format].
* `clojure -M:poly info since:previous-release`
** Prints workspace information.
* `clojure -M:poly deps since:previous-release`
** Prints the dependency information
* `clojure -M:poly libs since:previous-release`
** Prints all libraries that are used in the workspace.

After this job is done, all this information will be available in the jobs output for debugging purposes, if needed.
You can read more about available commands xref:commands.adoc[here].

==== Test

This job runs all the tests for all the bricks that are directly or indirectly changed since the last release.
It runs the following command: `clojure -M:poly test :project since:previous-release`.
If any of the tests fail, it will exit with a non-zero exit code, and the CircleCI workflow stops at this stage.
Information about the passed/failed tests will be printed in the job's output.

==== Deploy

This job deploys the changed projects to Clojars.
It's easy to deploy incrementally with the `poly` tool.
Changed projects are calculated since the latest release.
You can see how it's done https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/build.clj[here].
In a nutshell, it executes `poly ws get:changes:changed-or-affected-projects skip:dev since:previous-release` and only deploys the returned projects.

==== Create Artifacts

This job creates two types of artifacts per changed project, an AOT compiled uberjar and a package that can be used to deploy https://brew.sh[Homebrew].
Created artifacts can be found in the artifacts section of this job's output.

==== Publish GitHub Release

This job uploads the artifacts created after the previous job and uploads them to a new release in GitHub.
It makes use of the https://github.com/tcnksm/ghr[GHR] tool in order to create a new release on GitHub and upload the artifacts.
