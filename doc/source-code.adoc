= Source code

In all our examples so far, the source code has been stored in two directories, `src` and `test`.
xref:tools-deps.adoc[Tools.deps] supports splitting up the source and test code into several directories, and that is also supported by the `poly` tool.

It's also worth mentioning that the `poly` tool understands `.cljc` files which can be used to share code between `.clj` and `.cljs`.

Let's say we have a `company` component that contains both `.clj` and `.cljc` files.
Now we can choose to store both type of files in the same `src` directory:

[source,shell]
----
├── components
│   ├── company
│   │   ├── src
----

...and configure the component's `deps.edn` file like this:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["src"]
 ....
----

An alternative is to store the source code in two separate directories:

[source,shell]
----
├── components
│   ├── company
│   │   ├── clj
│   │   ├── cljc
----

...and configure them like this in the component's `deps.edn` file:

[source,clojure]
----
{:paths ["clj" "cljc"]
 ....
----

This can facilitate code sharing, as it becomes clear where all the `cljc` code resides.

== Resources

The `resources` directory is used to store non-source files, e.g. images or data, and lives in bricks and projects.
To avoid file naming conflicts, the tool creates a sub-directory under `resources`.
For components, the name is the component's xref:interface.adoc[interface] name, and for bases, it's the base name, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
├── bases
│   ├── worker
│   │   ├── resources
│   │   │   └── worker
│   │   │       └── mydata.edn
├── components
│   ├── creator
│   │   ├── resources
│   │   │   └── creator
│   │   │       └── logo.png
----

== Frontend

The `poly` tool doesn't understand https://clojurescript.org/[ClojureScript] code (`.cljs`), but does understand `.cljc` code, which we can use if we want to share code between backend and frontend.
To do so we have three alternatives:

==== 1. Put the frontend code in a base

One option is to put all the frontend code in a base.
The `poly` tool will recognise all `.cljc` code in the base, resulting in a "stripped" view of that component when used.

If we want to share the `cljc` code with the backend, then we should put that code in one or more components.

==== 2. Put the frontend code in a separate directory

Another option is to put the frontend code in a separate directory.
If we do that, we have two alternatives.

===== a) Let the frontend code live in the same workspace

[source,shell]
----
myworkspace
├── bases
├── components
├── development
├── myfrontend
└── projects
----

Now we can include `.cljc` files from our backend code, by treating them as libraries and "import" them with `:local/root`.
The drawback with this is that they will not be recognised as bricks, and changes to these files will not be recognised by the `poly` tool.
There are plans to fix this, see https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/discussions/301[this] discussion.

===== b) Let the frontend code live outside the workspace

We can also put the backend and frontend code in two separate directories within the same git repo.
The two directories can live anywhere in the repo, e.g. at the top level:

[source,shell]
----
myrepository
├── mybackend
│   ├── bases
│   ├── components
│   ├── development
│   └── projects
└── myfrontend
----

Here we can "import" `.cljc` files as libraries, in the same way as in alternative 2a.
The `poly` tool can handle both situations, so it's more a matter of preference what you choose.

==== 3. Let the frontend code live in another repository

The last alternative is to put the frontend code in a separate repository.
If we do that we will lose the Polylith way of sharing "living" code, by automatically having access to the latest version of the code.
Now we have to "freeze" the `.cljc` code by building a library of it, to be able to share the code.
