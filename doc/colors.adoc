= Colors

When we created the example workspace, the file _~/.config/polylith/config.edn_ was also created:

[source,clojure]
----
{:color-mode "dark"
 :thousand-separator ","
 :empty-character "Â·"}
----

For Windows systems the _color-mode_ is set to _none_ and for all other systems, _dark_ will be used as default. Valid values are: _none_, _light_ and _dark_.

In this documentation we have used the dark color schema, but we can switch to light by giving the color-mode parameter (or by updating ~/.config/polylith/config.edn):

[source,clojure]
----
poly info color-mode:light
----

image::images/misc/info-light.png[width=400]

...everything suddenly looks much brighter! The only difference between _light_ and _dark_ is that they use different https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/tree/master/components/util/src/polylith/clj/core/util/colorizer.clj[codes] for grey.

If we switch back to dark background and select _none_:

[source,clojure]
----
poly info color-mode:none
----

...things are now displayed without colors.

To refresh our memory, this is what it looked like using the dark color schema:

image::images/misc/info-dark.png[width=400]

If you want to use the same colors in your terminal, here they are:


|===
| name | color | RGB

| yellow a|image::images/misc/yelow.png[] | f8eeb6
| green a|image::images/misc/green.png[] | bfefc5
| blue a|image::images/misc/blue.png[] | 77bcfc
| purple a|image::images/misc/purple.png[] | e2aeff
| red a|image::images/misc/red.png[] | ee9b9a
| grey a|image::images/misc/grey.png[] | cccccc
| black a|image::images/misc/black.png[] | 24242b
|===

If the colors look familiar to you, it's because they are more or less stolen from the https://github.com/Misophistful/borealis-cursive-theme[Borealis] color schema! This color schema gives a really pleasant user experience when used from the text editor / IDE.
