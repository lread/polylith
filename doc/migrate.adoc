= Migrate

== Leiningen

The old https://github.com/tengstrand/lein-polylith[lein-polylith] tool has reached the end of its life
and has been replaced by this _tools.deps_ based version. If you have any old Leiningen based projects to migrate,
please follow the instructions https://github.com/tengstrand/lein-polylith/blob/migrate/migrate/migrate.md[here].

The biggest difference compared to the old tool is that the new tool is based on
https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha[tools.deps] instead of https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen]
which has a number of benefits, like an improved development experience, faster tests, Windows support, and more.

== Migrate

If the workspace has been created with https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha9[v0.1.0-alpha9]
or earlier, then it has to be migrated by following the instructions xref:migrate-workspace-from-v1-to-v2.adoc[here].
