= Configuration

The workspace configuration is stored in ./workspace.edn and defines the following keys:

|===
| Key | Description
| :vcs | A map with two keys, where _:name_ is set to "git" which is the only supported https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control[version control] system at the moment. The key _:auto-add_ is a boolean flag that tells whether directories and files added by the _create_ command should automatically be added to git or not.
| :top-namespace | The workspace top namespace. If changed, the source code has to be changed accordingly.
| :interface-ns | The default value is _interface_. If changed, the source code has to be changed accordingly.
| :default-profile-name | The default value is _default_. If changed (don't include the "+") the _+default_ alias in _./deps.edn_ has to be renamed accordingly.
| :tag-patterns | The default value for the _:release_ key is "v[0-9]*", and for _:stable_ it's "stable-*". If changed, old tags may not be recognised.
| :project | If the development key is missing, _{"development" {:alias "dev"}_ will be used under the hood.
|===

Only the _:top-namespace_ attribute is mandatory, all other attributes will use their default values if missing. A complete list of keys can be found in the workspace structure for the _:settings_ key.

The content of _workspace.edn_ can be viewed by executing:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:workspace
----

Settings that are unique per developer/user are stored in _~/.config/polylith/config.edn_ (if you started using the poly tool from version _0.2.14 or_ earlier, then it may be stored in _~/.polylith/config.edn_):

|===
| Key | Description
| :thousandâ€‘separator | Set to "," by default (when first created).
| :color-mode | Set to "none" on Windows, and to "dark" on other operating systems (when first created). Valid values are "none", "light" and "dark", see the color section. Can be overridden, e.g.: `poly info color-mode:none`.
| :empty-character | Set to "." by default (when first created). Used by the deps and libs commands.
| :m2-dir | If omitted, the _.m2_ directory will be set to _USER-HOME/.m2_. Used by the libs command to calculate file sizes (KB).
|===

If _~/.config/polylith/config.edn_ doesn't exist, it will be created the first time the create workspace command is executed, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
{:color-mode "dark"
 :thousand-separator ","
 :empty-character "."}
----

The content of the user config file can be viewed by:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs:user
----

The content of all config files (components, bases, projects, user, and workspace) can be viewed by executing:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:configs
----
