The poly tool comes with a xref:commands.adoc#doc[doc] command that helps us access the web based documentation.
The easiest way to access different parts of the documentation is by first starting a xref:shell.adoc[shell]:

[source,shell]
----
poly
----

We can now execute the `doc` command to open the start page of this documentation:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc
----

image::images/doc/top-doc.png[]

Here we have a number of useful links:

* image:images/doc/clj-poly-lib.png[] link to this documentation.

* image:images/doc/clj-poly-doc.png[] the version of this documentation, which links to a page that lists all the http://localhost:8000/versions/polylith/clj-poly[different versions] of this documentation, where `0.2.18` and later contains useful documentation (`0.2.17-alpha` and earlier only include the code).

* image:images/doc/clj-doc.png[] opens the https://cljdoc.org/[cljdoc.org] documentation which is the platform that stores this `clj-poly` documentation, together with other libraries and tools.

* image:images/doc/polylith-repo.png[] opens the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[polylith] GitHub repo.

* image:images/doc/latest-doc-badge.png[] opens the documentation for the latest https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases[release] which is the documentation you should use together with the `poly` command line tool.

* image:images/doc/snapshot-doc-badge.png[] opens the latest `SNAPSHOT` version of this documentation.

* image:images/doc/slack.png[] opens the https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/C013B7MQHJQ[#polylith] channel in the clojurians workspace in Slack.

====
NOTE: The `SNAPSHOT` documentation is built every time we commit something to the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[master] branch, which is documented xref:polylith-ci-setup.adoc#releases[here].
This is useful if we use the `poly` tool as a xref:install.adoc#github-dependency[GitHub dependency] and want to access its documentation.
====

If we type `doc` followed by a space, the different help categories are listed:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc
help   more   page   ws
----

We can either use the left menu, the search box, or the `doc` command to access different pages:

image::images/doc/doc-overview.png[]

== page

The `page` parameter is used to navigate the `poly` tool documentation.
We can pass in `page:` to list all pages, which are also accessible in the left menu (notice that it ends with a colon):

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc page:
artifacts                introduction
base                     libraries
build                    license
clojure-cli-tool         migrate
colors                   naming
component                polylith-ci-setup
configuration            polyx
contact                  profile
context                  project
continuous-integration   readme
dependencies             shell
developing-poly          source-code
development              tagging
doc                      tap
example-systems          test-runners
explore-the-workspace    testing
flags                    tools-deps
git-hooks                upgrade
git                      validations
install                  workspace
interface
----

If we select a page, it will be opened in a browser on your machine, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
doc page:flags
----

== help

The `help` parameter takes us to the xref:commands.adoc[commands] help page:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help
----

We can list all help commands with:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help:
check                deps-project         overview
create-base          deps-workspace       shell
create-component     deps                 switch-ws
create-project       diff                 tap
create-workspace     doc                  test
create               info                 version
deps-brick           libs                 ws
deps-project-brick   migrate
----

...and select a command:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help:check
----

...which take us to the web based help for the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command.
We will get the same output if we execute the corresponding `help` command:

[source,shell]
----
example$ help check
----

== ws

The `ws` parameter takes us to the xref:workspace-structure.adoc[Workspace structure] documentation:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws
----

We can list all top keys with:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws:
bases          name           version
changes        old            ws-dir
components     paths          ws-local-dir
configs        projects       ws-reader
interfaces     settings       ws-type
messages       user-input
----

...and open the description for a specific top key, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws:configs
----

== more

The `more` parameter stores all other documentation that is not about the `poly` tool:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc more:
blog-posts    slack
high-level    videos
podcasts      workspaces
python-tool
----

Let's dig into the different categories:

=== blog posts

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc more:blog-posts:
a-fresh-take-on-monorepos-in-python
how-polylith-came-to-life
the-micro-monolith-architecture
the-monorepos-polylith-series
the-origin-of-complexity
