= Doc
:toc:

The poly tool comes with a xref:commands.adoc#doc[doc] command that helps us access the web based documentation, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly doc
----

This opens this tool's readme file in a browser:

image::images/doc/poly-readme.png[width=400]

// Todo: explain the different parts of the page

By using the xref:commands.adoc#doc[doc] command, we can open different pages listed in the left menu by giving a page, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly doc page:component
----

We can improve the user experience by starting a xref:commands.adoc#shell[shell]
and letting the tool guide us to different help pages:

[source,shell]
----
poly
----

Now we can type `doc` followed by a space, from the shell, to list the different help categories:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc
help   more   page   ws
----

Let's dig into these.

== page

The `page` parameter is used to navigate the _poly_ tool documentation.
Notice that we have to end `page` with a `:` to list the pages:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc page:
base                     flags                    project
build                    git-hooks                readme
clojure-cli-tool         git                      shell
colors                   install                  source-code
component                interface                tagging
configuration            introduction             tap
context                  libraries                test-runners
continuous-integration   migrate                  testing
dependencies             naming                   tools-deps
development              parameters               upgrade
example-systems          polyx                    validations
explore-the-workspace    profile                  workspace
----

This lists all the pages of the _poly_ tool documentation, and is the same as the items in the left menu.

If we select a page, it will be opened in a browser on your machine, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
doc page:component
----

image::images/doc/component-page.png[width=400]

== help

The `help` parameter takes us to the xref:commands.adoc[commands] help:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help
----

We can list all help commands like this:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help:
check                deps-project         overview
create-base          deps-workspace       shell
create-component     deps                 switch-ws
create-project       diff                 tap
create-workspace     doc                  test
create               info                 ws
deps-brick           libs
deps-project-brick   migrate
----

..and select a command:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc help:check
----

...which take us to the web based help for the xref:commands.adoc#check[check] command.
The content of this help is taken from the output of the help of that command:

[source,shell]
----
poly help check
----

== ws

The `ws` parameter takes us to the xref:workspace-structure.adoc[Workspace structure] documentation:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws
----

We can list all top keys with:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws:
bases          name           version
changes        old            ws-dir
components     paths          ws-local-dir
configs        projects       ws-reader
interfaces     settings       ws-type
messages       user-input
----

...and then go to the description for one of the keys, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc ws:configs
----

== more

The _more_ parameter stores all other documentation that is not exclusively about the _poly_ tool:

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc more:
blog-posts    python-tool   workspaces
high-level    slack
podcasts      videos
----

Let's dig into the different types of documentation.

=== blog posts

[source,shell]
----
example$ doc more:blog-posts:
a-fresh-take-on-monorepos-in-python
how-polylith-came-to-life
