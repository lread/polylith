= Maintainers of poly

Here we will go through things that primarily have value if you are a developer of the poly tool itself.
Feel free to read what's in here, and hopefully you will pick up something of value.

== Parameters

There are a few parameters that are either rarely used, added to simplify maintenance work with the Polylith codebase,
or used in special circumstances. For these reasons, they are not suggested by the autocomplete when in a
xref:commands.adoc#shell[shell].
What most of them have in common is that they are used to control the output of the different `poly` commands.

=== all

If passing in `:all` to the xref:commands.adoc[help] command, the help for the  xref:commands.adoc#migrate[migrate]
command will also be included (it will also be included if the workspace needs to be migrated):

[source,shell]
----
poly help :all
----

We can also pass in `:all` when starting a shell:

[source,shell]
----
poly :all
----

This will activate autocomplete for all available parameters, even those that are rarely used, and mostly in the way,
and parameters that only make sense when developing the `poly` tool itself.
For example, `:fake-poly` is only used to fake that we use a released version of the `poly` tool.

Examples of other parameters that will also be available for some commands:
`branch`, `changed-files`, `color-mode`, `:compact`, `:local:`, `:no-changes`, `+`.

=== changed-files

This parameter is used to fake changes of files, and is used for testing purposes when developing the `poly` tool itself, e.g:

[source,shell]
----
poly info changed-files:components/file/polylith/clj/core/user_input/core.clj
----

More than one file can be marked as changed by separating them with colons (the autocomplete only works for the first file at the moment).

It's enough to include the brick or project name plus a slash, and the tool will treat the brick/project as changed, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly info changed-files:bases/mybase/:components/mycomponent/:projects/myproject/
----

=== fake-sha

This parameter can be passed in to fake a `sha` when executing the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command,
which is used when taking screenshots for this documentation.

[source,shell]
----
poly info fake-sha:c91fdad
----

=== fake-tag

This parameter can be passed in to fake a `tag` when executing the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command,
which sometimes is used when taking screenshots for this documentation, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly info fake-tag:stable-lisa
----

The tag can be removed with:

[source,shell]
----
poly info fake-tag:
----

=== fake-poly

This parameter is used to fake that we are using the `poly` tool,
when we actually use the `polyx` tool.

These two will remove the "-SNAPSHOT" from the output of the version number:

[source,shell]
----
poly help :fake-poly
----

[source,shell]
----
poly :fake-poly
----

=== latest-sha

This parameter is used to tell the tool to fetch the latest sha from the git repo (otherwise it's not populated), e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly ws get:settings:vcs:polylith:latest-sha :latest-sha
----

=== no-changes

This parameter can be used to fake that no changes have been made since the last stable point in time,
and can be used when taking a screenshot of the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command without getting the `*` characters.

* `poly diff :no-changes` Returns no rows.
* `poly info :no-changes` Gets rid of the * characters.

Has the same effect as:

[source,shell]
----
poly info changed-files:
----

=== no-exit

When the `poly` tool is executed, it exits with `System/exit` internally, see
https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/edaef89207c2852010132e863ae87ebba5bedc5b/bases/poly-cli/src/polylith/clj/core/poly_cli/core.clj#L33[poly-cli].
If executing the `poly` tool from a REPL, this will also exit the REPL.
To avoid that, we can pass in
https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/9053b190d5f3b0680ac4fe5c5f1851f7c0d40830/bases/poly-cli/src/polylith/clj/core/poly_cli/core.clj#L31-L32[:no-exit].

If we execute `poly info :no-exit` we have to press `<ctrl>+C` to exit, which is not so useful!

=== replace

This parameter is used to manipulate the output from the xref:commands.adoc#ws[ws] command.
When we execute `poly ws get:settings:user-home` it will return something like "/Users/joakimtengstrand".
We can tell the xref:commands.adoc#ws[ws] command to search for strings (using regular expressions) and replace the occurrences with another string,
e.g. (assumes that $HOME is set):

* `poly ws get:settings:user-home replace:$HOME:MY-HOME` Outputs: "MY-HOME".

* `poly ws get:settings:user-config-filename replace:$HOME:MY-HOME` Outputs: "MY-HOME/.polylith/config.edn".

* `poly ws get:settings:user-config-filename replace:$HOME:MY-HOME:config.edn:USER-CONFIG` Outputs: "MY-HOME/.polylith/USER-CONFIG".

* `poly ws get:settings:vcs:stable-since:sha replace:"[0-9]+":"*"` Outputs "*e*d*b*cee*fb*e*ff*fafcf".
Here we need to surround the regular expressions with "" for the terminal to ignore the special characters.

== Run cljdoc locally

To run the cljdoc documentation locally, we can start by cloning the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith[polylith] repo:

[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:polyfy/polylith.git
----

This is how the help for the
https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/0d204094cb597cea6be417ab05baa2139b78e6d1/bb.edn#L20[doc]
command looks like:

[source,shell]
----
cd polylith
bb doc help

Commands:
 start   Start docker containers supporting cljdoc preview
 ingest  Locally publishes poly for cljdoc preview
 view    Opens cljdoc preview in your default browser
 stop    Stops docker containers supporting cljdoc preview
 status  Status of docker containers supporting cljdoc preview
 help    Show this help
----

We can now start the server and publish the documentation locally (which takes a few minutes):

[source,shell]
----
cd polylith
bb doc start
bb doc ingest
----

If we are a maintainer of the `poly` tool itself, then start a shell:

[source,clojure]
----
poly :local
----

If we want to access the `poly` tool from another Polylith xref:workspace.adoc[workspace]
then we have to add or replace the `:poly` alias in that workspace (e.g. `myws/deps.edn`):

[source,clojure]
----
    ...
    :poly {:main-opts ["-m" "polylith.clj.core.poly-cli.core"]
           :extra-deps {polylith/clj-poly {:local/root "../polylith/projects/poly"}}}

----

Make sure the "../polylith/projects/poly" path points to the `poly` project in the cloned `polylith` workspace directory.

Now we can start a xref:commands.adoc#shell[shell] from our workspace:

[source,shell]
----
cd myws
clojure -M:poly :local
----

The `:local` flag will tell the `poly` tool to open pages on `http://localhost:8000` instead of `https://cljdoc.org`.

If we are in the polylith workspace root directory, we can start a shell with `:local` and then open the corresponding file in GitHub:

[source,shell]
----
cd polylith
clojure -M:poly :local
polylith$ doc page:component :github
----

And if we are in another branch than `master` it will open up that page in the correct branch.

But if we start a xref:commands.adoc#shell[shell] from another workspace, we will need to tell on which branch
the GitHub file should be opened up in, otherwise it will use `master` as default:

[source,shell]
----
cd myws
clojure -M:poly :local
polylith$ doc page:component branch:issue-318 :github
----

If we don't run a local server, we may want to always open pages on GitHub instead of cljdoc,
which can be achieved by passing in `:github` when starting a shell:

[source,shell]
----
cd myws
clojure -M:poly :github
polylith$ doc page:component
----

This will open the page on the `master` branch.
If we want to open the pages in another branch, we have to give the branch, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
cd myws
clojure -M:poly :github branch:issue-318
polylith$ doc page:component
----

This can be useful if we are a maintainer of the `poly` tool documentation.

== Reloading changes

Sometimes the cljdoc platform that builds the documentation has changed,
and in that case we need to restart the Docker container to get the latest version:

[source,shell]
----
bb doc stop
bb doc start
----

If the polylith codebase is changed, e.g. if we retrieve more commits or if we switch branch,
we have to run `ingest` again to get the latest and greatest (the server doesn't need to be restarted):

[source,shell]
----
bb doc ingest
----
