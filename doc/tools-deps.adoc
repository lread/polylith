= Tools.deps

This `poly` tool is built on top of tools.deps. To get the most out of it, we recommend you to read its
https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha[documentation].

When we created the workspace with the xref:commands#create-workspace[create workspace] command, the `poly` alias was also added to `./deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
    :poly {:main-opts ["-m" "polylith.clj.core.poly-cli.core"]
           :extra-deps {polyfy/polylith
                        {:git/url   "https://github.com/polyfy/polylith"
                         :sha       "1b91de1cb96dd286c9f5f9bda6a97d62c40b67a7"
                         :deps/root "projects/poly"}}}
----

This alias can now be used to execute the `poly` tool from the workspace root, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
cd ../..
clojure -M:poly info
----

It takes longer to execute the `poly` tool this way, because it needs to compile the Clojure code first,
but it also allows us to execute older or newer versions of the tool by selecting another `sha` from an
https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/commits/master[existing commit].

To speed things up we can always start a xref:commands.adoc#shell[shell]:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:poly
----

== clojure vs clj

In the example above, we started the `poly` tool using `clojure` which is preferable over `clj`
when executing a program like the `poly` tool, and is well described
https://betweentwoparens.com/blog/what-are-the-clojure-tools/#clj%2Fclojure[here].

If we use `clj` instead, things will still work, but we will get a warning in some situations:

[source,shell]
----
clj -M:poly
