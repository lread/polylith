= Upgrade

To upgrade the _poly_ tool on Mac, execute (this assumes you have it installed already):

[source,shell]
----
brew upgrade poly
----

...or use the full path (if needed):

[source,shell]
----
brew upgrade polyfy/polylith/poly
----

To upgrade on Windows and Linux: download the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases/latest[latest release] and replace the poly jar (e.g. poly-0.2.18.jar).
