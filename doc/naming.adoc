= Naming

Every time we create an `interface`, `component`, `base`, `project` or `workspace`, we need to come up with a good name.
Finding good names is one of the hardest and most important thing in software.
Every time we fail to find a good name, it will make the system harder to reason about and change.

The components are the core of Polylith, so let's start with them.
If a component does _one thing_ then we can name it based on that, e.g. `validator`, `invoicer` or `purchaser`.
Sometimes a component operates around a concept that we can name it after, e.g. `account` or `car`.
This can be an alternative if the component does more than one thing, but always around that single concept.

If the component's main responsibility is to simplify access to a third-party API, then suffixing it with `-api` is a good pattern, like `externalsystem-api`.
If we use a cloud service like https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS], we can drop the `-api` prefix and either use the plain service names, like `s3`, `dynamodb`, and `cloudwatch`, or prefix them like `aws-s3`, `aws-dynamodb`, and `aws-cloudwatch`, which will also group them nicely in different commands like the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command.

If we have two components that share the same interface, e.g. `invoicer`, where the `invoicer` component contains the business logic, while the other component only delegates to a service that includes the `invoicer` component, then we can name the component that does the remote call `invoicer-remote`.

If we have found a good name for the component, then it's generally a good idea to keep the same name for the interface, which is also the default behavior when a component is created, e.g.:

[source,shell]
----
poly create component name:invoicer
----

...which is the same as:

[source,shell]
----
poly create component name:invoicer interface:invoicer
----

Bases are responsible for exposing a public API and delegating the incoming calls to components.
A good way to name them is to start with what they do, followed by the type of the API.

If it's a REST API that takes care of invoicing, then we can name it `invoicer-rest-api`.
If it's a lambda function that generates different reports, then `report-generator-lambda` can be a good name.

Projects represent the deployable artifacts (development excluded).
Services can be named after what they are, like `invoicer` or `report-generator`.
For tools, we can use the tool name.
