== Polylith as a library

If we are building tooling around Polylith, then we can use the https://clojars.org/polylith/clj-poly/versions[clj-poly] library, that exposes two interfaces:

* The https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/components/api/src/polylith/clj/core/api/interface.clj[api] interface.

* The https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/components/test-runner-contract/src/polylith/clj/core/test_runner_contract/interface.clj[test-runner-contract] interface.

Since version 0.2.18 we only publish _clj-poly_ (not the old _clj-api_) to Clojars that now also includes the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/master/components/api/src/polylith/clj/core/api/interface.clj[api].

You can add _clj-poly_ as a dependency to a _:deps_ section in your _deps.edn_ file (make sure to use the https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/releases[latest] release):

[source,shell]
----
polylith/clj-poly {:mvn/version "0.2.18"}
----

or

[source,shell]
----
polylith/clj-api {:git/url   "https://github.com/polyfy/polylith.git"
:sha       "ecd2cf2ede81ecd4fbf82f21a075b103b6f2d2af"
:deps/root "projects/poly"}
----

...and remember to set the _:sha_ to an existing https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/commits/master[SHA].
