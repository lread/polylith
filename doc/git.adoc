= Git

We have already used the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command a couple of times without explaining everything in its output.

Let's execute the xref:commands.adoc#info[info] command again to see the current state of the workspace:

[source,shell]
----
cd ../../..
poly info
----

image::images/git/info.png[alt=info,width=400]

At the top we have the line _stable since: c91fdad_ (you most likely have another git SHA/hash).
To explain what this is, let's take it from the beginning.

If we pass in :commit when a Polylith workspace is created these git commands are executed:

[source,shell]
----
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Workspace created."
----

If we don't pass in _:commit_ to the xref:commands.adoc#create-workspace[create workspace] command (and _:auto-add_ is not set to _true_)
then we have to perform these (or similar) commands manually.

If we run `git log` from the workspace root, it returns something like this:

[source,shell]
----
commit c91fdad4a34927d9aacfe4b04ea2f304f3303282 (HEAD -> main)
Author: lisa <lisa@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 3 06:11:23 2020 +0200

    Workspace created.
----

This is the first and only commit of this repository so far.
This is also the first _stable point in time_ of this workspace
which the tool uses when it calculates what changes have been made (up till now).
Notice that the first letters of the hash correspond to _stable since: c91fdad_
and this is because it refers to this SHA-1 hash in git.

We told the IDE to automatically add new files to git, but if we didn't, we can add them now:

[source,shell]
----
git add --all
----

The _command-line_ and _development_ projects, and the _user_ and _cli_ bricks are all marked with an asterisk, _*_.
The way the tool calculates changes is to ask _git_ by running this command internally:

[source,shell]
----
git diff c91fdad4a34927d9aacfe4b04ea2f304f3303282 --name-only
----

We can also run the xref:commands.adoc#diff[diff] command, which will execute the same git statement internally:

[source,shell]
----
poly diff
----

The output is the same (this assumes that you have added the files to your git repository):

[source,shell]
----
include::../scripts/output/git-diff.txt[]
----

Here we have the answer to where the _*_ signs come from.
The paths that start with _projects/command-line/_, _development/_, _components/user/_ and _bases/cli/_
makes the tool understand that _command-line_, _development_, _user_ and _cli_ are changed.

When we created the workspace, a https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore[.gitignore] file was also created for us.
Now is a good time to add more rows here if needed:

[source,shell]
----
**/classes
...
----

Let's add and commit the changed files:

[source,shell]
----
git add --all
git commit -m "Created the user and cli bricks."
----

Let's have a look at our workspace repository again:

[source,shell]
----
git log --pretty=oneline
----

[source,shell]
----
e7ebe683a775ec28b7c2b5d77e01e79d48149d13 (HEAD -> main) Created the user and cli bricks.
c91fdad4a34927d9aacfe4b04ea2f304f3303282 Workspace created.
----

If we run the _info_ command again, it will return the same result as before,
and the reason is that we haven't told git to move the _stable point in time_ to our second commit.

We said that the _diff_ command returns the same result as _git diff SHA --name-only_.
This is normally true, except for the case when the workspace lives inside a git repo.
In that case, the _git diff_ command will also return the workspace directory in the path
(which is stripped away by the _poly_ tool).
This directory can be shown by running the poly _ws get:ws-local-dir_ command.
