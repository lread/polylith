== Install on Mac

To use the poly tool and to get access to all the features in tools.deps, make sure you have https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[CLI tools] and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git] installed. If you install git for the first time, don't forget to set the https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git[user] name and email.

To install the _poly_ command on Mac, execute:

[source,shell]
----
brew install polyfy/polylith/poly
----

If you get the error "openjdk-13.0.2.jdk could not be opened...", do this:

- Open MacOS "System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General".
- Click Allow at the bottom for "openjdk-13.0.2.jdk".
- Run brew install `polyfy/polylith/poly` again.

Verify the installation by executing `poly help`.
