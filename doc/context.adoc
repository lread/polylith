= Context

The component interfaces bring context to the development experience.

Object oriented languages give us context by using objects. Letâ€™s say we work in an object oriented language and that we want to save the object _userToBeSaved_. If we type _userToBeSaved_ followed by a ., the intellisense in the IDE will show us a list of available methods for that object, for example _persist_:

[source,java]
----
userToBeSaved.persist(db)
----

...or if implemented as a service:

[source,java]
----
userService.persist(db, userToBeSaved)
----

With Polylith we get the same level of support from the IDE by first importing the user interface and then typing:

[source,java]
----
(user/
----

Now the IDE will list all available functions in the _user_ interface and one of them would be _persist!_:

[source,clojure]
----
(user/persist! db user-to-be-saved)
----
