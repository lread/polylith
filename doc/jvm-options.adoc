== JVM options

If we want to add extra memory to the _poly_ tool or maybe specify where the configuration file for the logging is stored, then we can set the _JVM_OPTS_ environment variable to do that, because _JVM_OPTS_ is also https://github.com/polyfy/polylith/blob/9053b190d5f3b0680ac4fe5c5f1851f7c0d40830/build/resources/brew/exec#L22[passed in] when executing the _poly_ command.

If we use the tools.deps CLI to execute the _poly_ command, e.g. `clojure -M:poly test`, we can configure the logging in the _:poly_ alias in _./deps.edn_ for the project, e.g.:

[source,clojure]

            :poly {...
                   :extra-deps {...
