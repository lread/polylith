= Tap

The _tap_ command is mainly for _poly_ tool development for now,
but might be interesting for those who like to peek under the covers and understand how things work.

We can open a https://github.com/djblue/portal[portal] window by passing in _:tap_ when starting a shell,
e.g. _poly :tap_ or by executing the xref:commands.adoc#tap[tap] command from a shell:

The portal window outputs data from https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/tap%3E[tap>]
statements produced by the _poly_ tool itself.

Let's continue by looking at tools.deps.
